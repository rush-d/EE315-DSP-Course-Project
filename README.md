Please go to this folder and run 'BothModules.mlx' file to see the performances of various methods used for speech enhancement and to see the plots and inferences.

The techniques implemented are as follows :
1. Wiener Noise Reduction Technique - Using Two Step Noise Reduction (TSNR) Method
2. Wiener Noise Reduction Technique - Using Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) Method
3. Spectral Signal Subtraction (SSS) Method
4. Spectral Amplitude Minimum Mean Square Error Method for Denoising Noisy Speech
